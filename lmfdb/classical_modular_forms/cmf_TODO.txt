CRITICAL (BUGS):
* knowls: reliability, cande, source in the new paradigm (and indicate that CM is rigorous but inner twist is numerical) (Drew)

IMPORTANT:
* code snippets for form and space pages (Drew)
* Create appropriate indexes -> look at slow queries from cmfs.lmfdb.xyz and when running tests (Edgar)
* 2d tables (is_CM, is_RM, both, neither) (count by level/dimension) (David)
* Add is_CM, is_RM (in weight 1 and overall) (David)
* Field display on list is broken (Drew)
-------------------------- Pull Request Line -------------------------------------------------
* add ECQD and genus 2 curves to friends (Edgar)
* Speed up Dirichlet character search (currently doing a ton of lookup and lucky calls rather than using search() (David LD)
* data: compute exact Hecke eigenvalues in pari, compare with computed in Magma (JC, Drew)
* form pages: weight 1 link to Artin rep (Drew)
* avoid access exclusive lock with the alter table when using copy from
* Compute completions at global fields (primes dividing level), compute decomposition groups, embeddings (David)

GOOD:
* col_type is cached add to FAQ 
* self-twist sometimes wraps
* move the constant coefficient in q-exp coefficients to the left
* merge L-function data of G2C, EC, ECNF with CMF using trace_hash
* Reduce clutter in the url (cleanSubmit doesn't seem to be getting everything)
* Update Fricke eigenvalue to sign of the functional equation (after figuring out where this makes sense)
* knowls: mf.elliptic.hecke_order, mf.elliptic.embedding_label
* knowls: make sure top and bottom knowls, explicit formulas are ported over
* knowl: add remark to sturm_bound knowl for why our sturm bound is off by 1 from Sage (floor vs ceiling)

FORMATTING:
* Consider switching level and weight on browse and refine search input boxes

IT WOULD BE NICE IF:
* it would be nice if, if hecke field is cyclotomic don't use \zeta_3
* show AL dimensions for old forms as well as new
* LMFDB-wide: download link to get all data being used to generate page (see Download All Stored Data on elliptic curves)
* LMFDB-wide: equal signs consistent in terms of math-mode or not
* LMFDB-wide: change sort order in search results
* knowls: more
* form pages: if Hecke ring is a power basis, order the generators by the powers and pretty print the q-expansion
* identify (if possible?) a more precise description of the twisting characters
* data: download data from old version and compare to see matches (at least with traces) and identify other problems
* form pages: download to Sage/Magma/pari (using cutters)
* What about putting in "nice latex" for q-exp when available, e.g. if beta_i = nu^i and nu has a nice rep (like sqrt{N} or zeta_n)?
* form pages: provide downloads of q-expansions for Magma/pari

FUTURE WORK:
* data: compute much more using pari
* Review editorial review of CMFs to make sure issues have been addressed
* data: add trace hash for ECNF L-fun
* data: make friends with base changes of HMFs and BMFs
* Add more data, in particular for weight 2 and trivial character
* data: add data for is_twist_minimal

NOT CMF STUFF:
* reset start with javascript
* generalize search_types
* hidden != search clean hidden
* add utf8 check to pyflakes
* pick columns and sort order on search results
* add UIs to pick random objects with contraints
* bread for maass forms looks dumb http://127.0.0.1:37777/L/ModularForm/GSp4/Q/Maass/1/1/12.46875_4.720951/1.34260324/#footer
* http://127.0.0.1:37777/L/ModularForm/GSp4/Q/Maass/1/1/12.46875_4.720951/1.34260324/#footer should explain why it is the grand canyon l-function, there is a knowl for this but after some renaming of maass forms it doesn't show on the page!
* fix hmf and bmf l-functions
* Shrink the sidebar with a button analogous to the properties shrinker
* Related fields for dirichlet characters that are Kronecker symbols

TO THINK ABOUT:
* Are there good reasons for why traces are often zero for many small primes (e.g. 60.2.j)
